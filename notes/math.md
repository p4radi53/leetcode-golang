### 🚩 Red Flags That It's Math (Not Backtracking):

1. ✅ **Only asks for COUNT** (not the actual solutions)
   - "Return the **number of ways**..." ← Math!
   - vs "Return **all ways**..." ← Backtracking

2. ✅ **Large constraints** (n up to 10⁶ or 10⁹)
   - If brute force would take O(n²) or more → must be math
